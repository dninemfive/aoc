# Advent of Code 2023
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) problems.

i have no intention of getting on the leaderboard, but i am committing to a private branch for each day's solutions and will make sure the leaderboard is full before merging into `main`.

My goal is to make my code as readable and maintainable as possible, but we'll see how well i can do that.
